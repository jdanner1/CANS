 ### Week 7
 
 * Completed feedback for peer review 1, placing issues in John and Kevin's projects
 * Came to the realization that craigslist would never get back to me.  Decided now was the time to find a better option so I researched APIs.
 * Decided to take a closer look at a Watson API.  Navigated the maze of documentation to get set up with IBM and for the desired API specifcally.
 * Built a class that would allow me to make a test call.  It works and it is awesome.
 * Refactored my indie project to work with Watson API.  Updated the database, test database, entities, dropped unneeded tables, revised my testDAOs, Problem Statement and screen mockups.  All tests pass after this work.
 * Refactored my DOAs to use the generic instead, deleted the old ones.
 * Created shells for my JSPs and built a header and footer to include in these.  Also set up CSS and JS (direcotries and files) plus an images folder to get the web app a little further along.
 * Worked through the AWS setup, have both week 1 and indie project deployed.  JS appears broken in the indie and data access is broken probably for both but certainly for week 1.  Need to fix this.
